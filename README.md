- "Create a table of the cities in the Netherlands where VanMoof rides are tracked with longitude and latitude columns"  
  "Retrieves a list of cities in the Netherlands where VanMoof rides are tracked and formats them into a table with columns for longitude and latitude."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Your rider preferences

- "Get my VanMoof's rider preferences"

## üîå Getting Started

### Install Python

The VanMoof MCP Server requires Python. If you have not it installed, follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

### Install uv 
Also install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). This an extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust. Follow the instruction [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) to install uv.

### Clone MCP-SERVER-VANMOOF Github Repository.

run below command in your terminal:

```pwsh
git clone https://github.com/stefanstranger/mcp-server-vanmoof
```

### Test and debug VanMoof MCP Server

The MCP inspector is a developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers.

Before local debugging and testing configure the .env file with your VanMoof credentials.

Rename the .env-example file to .env and configure your VanMoof credentials.

Run the following to test and debug the VanMoof MCP Server:

```bash
mcp dev c:\github\mcp-server-vanmoof\server.py
```

Configure the following arguments:

run --with mcp[cli] --with requests --with tzlocal mcp run c://github//mcp-server-vanmoof//server.py

And the Environment Arguments for VANMOOF_USERNAME and VANMOOF_PASSWORD in the Webbrowser after you have started the MCP inspector.

#### Launching MCP Inspector

There are two ways to launch MCP Inspector:

- Launch with MCP CLI
- Launch with npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector

If you install the SDK with the cli option like uv add "mcp[cli]", you can use the MCP CLI. To start MCP Inspector, run mcp dev.

## üîß Setup
